    help
      Default value large enough to receive a 512 byte flash page for DFU.

config THINGSET_CAN_RX_BUF_PER_SENDER_SIZE
    int "ThingSet CAN per-sender RX buffer size"
    range 32 512
    default 64
    help
      Default value enough to receive at least a 10-element array via broadcast.

config THINGSET_CAN_NUM_BUFFERS
    int "ThingSet CAN number of per-sender RX buffers"
    range 1 64
    default 8
    help
      Number of unique senders anticipated on the CAN bus.

config THINGSET_CAN_MULTIPLE_INSTANCES
    bool "Support for multiple ThingSet CAN instances"
    help
      If enabled, the CAN message processing does not happen in the
      background anymore. Instead, each instance has to be initialized
      for a dedicated CAN device and and messages have to be processed
      manually in application threads.

config THINGSET_CAN_RESPONSE_DELAY
    int "ThingSet CAN response delay"
    range 0 100
    default 10
    help
      Wait for the specified delay in milliseconds before sending out a
      response after a request was received.

      This delay gives the requesting side some more time to switch between
      sending and receiving mode, as the Zephyr ISO-TP implementation does
      not allow to use the same ID for listening and sending simultaneously.

config THINGSET_CAN_THREAD_STACK_SIZE
    int "ThingSet CAN thread stack size"
    depends on !THINGSET_CAN_MULTIPLE_INSTANCES
    default 2048
    help
      Stack size of thread for processing ThingSet messages transmitted
      via CAN ISO-TP.

      Only available for single-instance implementation.

config THINGSET_CAN_THREAD_PRIORITY
    int "ThingSet CAN thread priority"
    depends on !THINGSET_CAN_MULTIPLE_INSTANCES
    default 2
    help
      Priority of thread for processing ThingSet messages transmitted
      via CAN ISO-TP.

      Only available for single-instance implementation.
